# FUNCTION

def nearest_neighbor(src, dst):

    Find the nearest (Euclidean) neighbor in dst for each point in src.
    Input:
        src: Nxm array of points
        dst: Nxm array of points
    Output:
        distances: Euclidean distances of the nearest neighbor
        indices: dst indices of the nearest neighbor
